            <p>
              I study the joint decision of fertility and location choice, focusing on housing demand and tenure adjustments.
              Using PSID and ACS data, I document that new parents often move for housing expansion, accepting real income losses
              while relocating towards cheaper, lower-wage areas. I complement this with the well-established fact that tenure
              status (owning versus renting) affects fertility and location decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              To rationalize these facts, I develop a quantitative spatial equilibrium model of fertility and location decisions
              with tenure choice. In the model, having children increases housing requirements, intensifying the trade-off households
              face between housing affordability and local wages or amenities. This interaction drives spatial sorting fertility patterns.

              Recent empirical evidence shows substantial consumption segregation across the United States and that consumption
              baskets differ markedly across the income distribution. We explain these empirical patterns using a spatial model
              of product-market search with non-homothetic preferences and endogenous firm and household location.
            </p>
            <p>
              The calibrated model replicates observed empirical regularities. We study the introduction of publicly-owned
              grocery stores aimed at decreasing non-durable good prices and find that congestion forces prevent the policy
              from reaching its intended goals. This work highlights how the interaction between shopping behavior, consumption
              segregation externalities, and housing-market congestion shapes urban consumption inequality.

            <p>
              Using ACS microdata, I document new facts on the heterogeneity of paid rents across individuals and cities.
              First, young people tend to pay higher rents and move more frequently, especially in denser and less housing-elastic
              cities. Second, recent movers—both within and across cities—pay systematically higher rents. These effects are
              heterogeneous across space and stronger in larger, denser metropolitan areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              To rationalize these patterns, I develop a parsimonious model of directed search in the rental market. The model
              explains the observed dispersion in paid rents and implies that increases in housing supply would disproportionately
              benefit younger and more mobile households.
